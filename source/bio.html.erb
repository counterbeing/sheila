    <p>
      With thirty years experience in counseling and coaching, Dr. Vaughn brings
      a wealth of experience, knowledge and judgment to leadership development.
      She has been an adjunct instructor at the University of California, Irvine
      for 20 years with excellent teaching ratings by students and an energetic
      presentation style.  Sheila has coached and facilitated extensively in a
      variety of topics on personal and leadership development, team building
      and conflict resolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sheila has been transitioning her focus from traditional psychology to
      professional  and business issues, where clients were challenged in developing
      leadership and communication skills. It was this experience that convinced Dr.
      Vaughn to move to a business setting where she could be more effective in
      providing behavioral feedback and leadership training.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dr. Vaughn’s approach is to focus on the manager’s strengths and how to
      use them effectively while mitigating any problem areas. She, and her
      client, work as a team to develop goals and to develop a specific plan for
      achieving those goals. She is able to draw on many years of experience to
      quickly assess what might be causing problems and give feedback on how to
      improve performance.  She believes that when people improve their
      performance and are more effective at their jobs, everyone benefits
